this is a simple verilog based signed (read as 2's complement here) multiplier.

the alternate folder has an equivalent 2's complement multiplier written by theja (totally hardcoded) using the wallace adder tree.

the alternate as well as the present multipliers reduce the system freqnency (theja's comjecture in April).
